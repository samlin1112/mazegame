# MazeGame

This is a maze game developed using C# WinForms.

## Game Instructions

* The maze is generated using a random algorithm, ensuring there is exactly one path from the start point to the endpoint.
* Press `R` to regenerate the maze.
* Press the `Spacebar` to reset the player to the starting point.

## Installation and Running

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Ensure .NET Framework/WinForms is available and running.
3. After compiling, run the application directly.

## Details

* Starting point: Top-left corner (0,0)
* Endpoint: Bottom-right corner (Rows-1, Cols-1)
* You can modify constants such as Rows/Cols/CellSize/WallsThickness to adjust the maze’s size and appearance.
